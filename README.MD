## Overview

### Links

- Live Site URL: [PIXEL 4 KIDS website](https://pixel4kids.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Accesibility 
- CSS:
  - Grid
  - Flexbox
  - Custom variables
  - Media Queries
- SASS:
  - Partials
  - Mixins
  - Sass variables
- Javascript

### Difficulties

As I wanted to make a bilingual page that was also accessible, the logic of translating both the content and the aria-labels, or alt tags, was definitely a challenge. Also, the javascript needed to make the bucket and the brush functional might not seem complicated, but it was a difficult and rewarding obstacle to beat.
